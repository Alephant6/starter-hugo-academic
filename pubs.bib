            Linear canonical transform ({LCT}) is a powerful tool for improving the detection accuracy of the conventional Wigner distribution ({WD}). However, the {LCT} free parameters embedded increase computational complexity. Recently, the instantaneous cross-correlation function type of {WD} ({ICFWD}), a specific {WD} relevant to the {LCT}, has shown to be an outcome of the tradeoff between detection accuracy and computational complexity. In this paper, the {ICFWD} is applied to detect noisy single component and bi-component linear frequency-modulated ({LFM}) signals through the output signal-to-noise ratio ({SNR}) inequality modeling and solving with respect to the {ICFWD} and {WD}. The expectation-based output {SNR} inequality model between the {ICFWD} and {WD} on a pure deterministic signal added with a zero-mean random noise is proposed. The solutions of the inequality model in regard to single component and bi-component {LFM} signals corrupted with additive zero-mean stationary noise are obtained respectively. The detection accuracy of {ICFWD} with that of the closed-form {ICFWD} ({CICFWD}), the affine characteristic Wigner distribution ({ACWD}), the kernel function Wigner distribution ({KFWD}), the convolution representation Wigner distribution ({CRWD}) and the classical {WD} is compared. It also compares the computing speed of {ICFWD} with that of {CICFWD}, {ACWD}, {KFWD} and {CRWD}.},

	abstract = {The traditional Wigner distribution ({WD}) is extended to a novel one inspired by the definition of fractional bispectrum, giving rise to a scaled version with respect to the frequency variable, termed as the scaled Wigner distribution ({SWD}). A natural magnification effect characterized by a factor ùëò on the frequency axis enables the {SWD} to have flexibility to be used in cross-term reduction. Some essential properties of this variation generalize very nicely and simply the classical results for the {WD}, and it enjoys a computational complexity in the order of ùëÇ(ùëòùëÅ2) comparable to ùëÇ(ùëÅ2) of the {WD}. The {SWD} does not use localization windows, but its resolutions depend on the factor ùëò. Comparison of the detection performance (i.e. cross-term reduction, time‚Äìfrequency resolution, angle or distance resolution) of {SWD} and {WD} for multicomponent linear frequency-modulated ({LFM}) signals processing is then observed by exploring the factor ùëò selection results on two kinds of bi-component cases, including the one with a different frequency rate and the other one with the same frequency rate but having a different initial frequency. Correctness of the derived results and the {SWD}‚Äôs superiority in the instantaneous frequency estimation of noisy {LFM} signals compared with the {WD} are illustrated through simulations, and finally further discussions point out some promising future research directions and perspectives.},

	abstract = {Recently, Wigner distribution ({WD}) associated with linear canonical transforms ({LCTs}) is quickly becoming a promising technique for detecting linear frequency-modulated ({LFM}) signals corrupted with noises by establishing output signal-to-noise ratio ({SNR}) inequality model or optimization model. Particularly, the closed-form instantaneous cross-correlation function type of {WD} ({CICFWD}), a unified linear canonical Wigner distribution, has shown to be competitive in detecting noisy {LFM} signals under an extremely low {SNR}. However, the {CICFWD} has up to nine {LCT} free parameters so that it requires a heavy computational load. To improve the efficiency of real-time processing, this paper focuses on the instantaneous cross-correlation function type of {WD} ({ICFWD}), which has only six {LCT} free parameters but is not a special case of the {CICFWD}. The main advantage of {ICFWD} is that it could be expected to reduce the computational complexity while maintaining detection performance. This paper first proposes an optimization model to the {ICFWD}‚Äôs output {SNR} with respect to deterministic signals embedded in additive zero-mean noises. It then deduces the model‚Äôs solution to a single component {LFM} signal added with white noise, leading to the optimal selection strategy on {LCT} free parameters. Simulation results demonstrate that the {ICFWD} improves almost a doubling of computing speed in comparison with the {CICFWD} while sharing the same level of detection performance. To be specific, the computing time of {ICFWD} in sampling frequencies 5‚ÄâHz, 10‚ÄâHz, 15‚ÄâHz, and 20‚ÄâHz is about 0.048‚Äâs, 0.111‚Äâs, 0.226‚Äâs, and 0.392‚Äâs, respectively, while 0.075‚Äâs, 0.233‚Äâs, 0.478‚Äâs, and 0.821‚Äâs for the computing time of {CICFWD}; the {ICFWD} and {CICFWD} have nearly the same output {SNR} higher than that of the {WD}.},
