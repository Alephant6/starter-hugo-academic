abstract: Abstract Linear canonical transform (LCT) is a powerful tool for improving
  the detection accuracy of the conventional Wigner distribution (WD). However, the
  LCT free parameters embedded increase computational complexity. Recently, the instantaneous
  cross-correlation function type of WD (ICFWD), a specific WD relevant to the LCT,
  has shown to be an outcome of the tradeoff between detection accuracy and computational
  complexity. In this paper, the ICFWD is applied to detect noisy single component
  and bi-component linear frequency-modulated (LFM) signals through the output signal-to-noise
  ratio (SNR) inequality modeling and solving with respect to the ICFWD and WD. The
  expectation-based output SNR inequality model between the ICFWD and WD on a pure
  deterministic signal added with a zero-mean random noise is proposed. The solutions
  of the inequality model in regard to single component and bi-component LFM signals
  corrupted with additive zero-mean stationary noise are obtained respectively. The
  detection accuracy of ICFWD with that of the closed-form ICFWD (CICFWD), the affine
  characteristic Wigner distribution (ACWD), the kernel function Wigner distribution
  (KFWD), the convolution representation Wigner distribution (CRWD) and the classical
  WD is compared. It also compares the computing speed of ICFWD with that of CICFWD,
  ACWD, KFWD and CRWD.
