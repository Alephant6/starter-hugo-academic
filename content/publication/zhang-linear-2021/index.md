abstract: In consideration of the latest second-order moment variance type of signal-to-noise
  ratio (SNR), the so-called variance-SNR, a new inequality model, namely, the variance-SNR
  inequality between the closed-form instantaneous cross-correlation function type
  of Wigner distribution and the classical Wigner distribution, is introduced to characterize
  the detection performance improvement triggered by linear canonical transform (LCT)
  free parameters embedded. Combining the newly established variance-SNR inequality
  model with the previous output SNR inequality model gives a stronger inequalities
  system. Solving it with respect to noisy onecomponent linear frequency-modulated
  signals yields more accurate strategies on determination of parameters. Numerical
  simulations also verify the correctness and rationality of the results of the theoretical
  deduction, implying that there is a better noise suppression effect by using the
  newly derived parameters selection strategies.
