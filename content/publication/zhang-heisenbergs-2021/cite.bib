 abstract = {The latest 𝑁-dimensional Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle associated with complex-valued functions’ uncertainty product in the Fourier transform domain is extended into two fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) domains. The result derived is sharper than the existing ones in the literature, giving rise to a tighter lower bound on the uncertainty product in time and 𝑁dimensional FRFT domains, as well as that in two 𝑁-dimensional FRFT domains. Example and simulations also validate the correctness of theoretical analyses, and finally the effectiveness is illustrated by applications in the effective estimation of spreads in time–frequency analysis and optical systems analysis.},
