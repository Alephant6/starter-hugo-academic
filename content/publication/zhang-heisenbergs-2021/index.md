abstract: The latest ùëÅ-dimensional Heisenberg‚Äôs uncertainty principle associated with
  complex-valued functions‚Äô uncertainty product in the Fourier transform domain is
  extended into two fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) domains. The result derived
  is sharper than the existing ones in the literature, giving rise to a tighter lower
  bound on the uncertainty product in time and ùëÅdimensional FRFT domains, as well
  as that in two ùëÅ-dimensional FRFT domains. Example and simulations also validate
  the correctness of theoretical analyses, and finally the effectiveness is illustrated
  by applications in the effective estimation of spreads in time‚Äìfrequency analysis
  and optical systems analysis.
