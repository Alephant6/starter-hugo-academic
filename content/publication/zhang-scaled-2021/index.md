abstract: The traditional Wigner distribution (WD) is extended to a novel one inspired
  by the definition of fractional bispectrum, giving rise to a scaled version with
  respect to the frequency variable, termed as the scaled Wigner distribution (SWD).
  A natural magnification effect characterized by a factor 𝑘 on the frequency axis
  enables the SWD to have flexibility to be used in cross-term reduction. Some essential
  properties of this variation generalize very nicely and simply the classical results
  for the WD, and it enjoys a computational complexity in the order of 𝑂(𝑘𝑁2) comparable
  to 𝑂(𝑁2) of the WD. The SWD does not use localization windows, but its resolutions
  depend on the factor 𝑘. Comparison of the detection performance (i.e. cross-term
  reduction, time–frequency resolution, angle or distance resolution) of SWD and WD
  for multicomponent linear frequency-modulated (LFM) signals processing is then observed
  by exploring the factor 𝑘 selection results on two kinds of bi-component cases,
  including the one with a different frequency rate and the other one with the same
  frequency rate but having a different initial frequency. Correctness of the derived
  results and the SWD’s superiority in the instantaneous frequency estimation of noisy
  LFM signals compared with the WD are illustrated through simulations, and finally
  further discussions point out some promising future research directions and perspectives.
